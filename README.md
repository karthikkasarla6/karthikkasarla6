Hello!

I am Karthik kasarla. I'm a 19-year-old Programmer / Developer / IT Undergrad currently living in Hyderabad. I've got a burning passion to want to help others with the code I create. I enjoy the limitless potential of impact that I can have on what I'm building. It's what pushes me to become a better developer every day.

I strive for excellence in everything that I do and I am a firm believer in leaving each place or situation that I cross paths with in a better condition than I found it.
